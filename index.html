<p>
  Chicken has two legs. Both legs are cute. But their wings are even cuter. The most pitiful part is they cannot fly though they have wings. B/C chicken wings cannot fly, people killed chickens and fry their wings. This is sort of like life: if you are lazy and cannot use you limbs well, they become useless. Other people disrespect you and you suffer a lot. Either you fly or you die.
</p>
<p>
  Beef has four legs. All legs are cute. But their cannot run outside the farm. They are too addicted to the grass and forget to run. B/C chicken wings cannot run away, people killed beef and make steak. This is sort of like life: if you are lazy and don't run hard, they become useless. Other people disrespect you and you suffer a lot. Either you run or you die.
</p>

  Fish has no legs. But they can swim. But they are silly to swim to the net. They are too addicted to the food and forget the danger. Pepole caught fish and make sushi. This is sort of like life: if you are lazy and stupid, you have danger. Other people disrespect you and you suffer a lot. Either you become smart or you die.
</p>
<p>
  Human are crule. They killed any animal. But human themself suffer a lot because they are never fulfilled. So they are very unhappy. Why are you unhappy? Think about it. I will be happy if I pass this exam. Otherwise, I will be unhappy too. Life is so easy and difficult. 
  Cherish every good person around you.
